## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to improve from our week 8 demo and give ourselves enough time to practice and prepare for what became an amazing week 9 demo. Last week we fell a little behind schedule but this week we were able to come together and really tackle the remaining tasks so I’m really proud of us.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 
I think the biggest challenge we faced this week was the bug bash. Our site crashed and our functionality stopped working so none of our peers could give us constructive feedback on the site's functionality. We spent the majority of this week combing through and fixing all of the bugs.


* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

This week our main tasks just involved fixing all of the bugs and completing all of the core features on our website. We wanted to do stretch features but we were not sure if we would be able to because we had so many bugs in our core functionality to comb through and fix. Our pod made great progress this week to ensure we would have a functional website that executes what we had envisioned in the planning phases and we did just that in our demo.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We found the teaching team as a resource that proved to be very helpful. We had so many Axios errors and 429 errors coming up as we tried to debug and the entire teaching team was so patient in helping us resolve everything from errors to merge conflicts.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I think the stretch features are considered at risk because next week our code will be frozen so we’ve run out of time to get to them. The site isn't any more or less impressive without them but it would have been nice to get to them. One of our features was the notification API, Novu which we decided to scrap because it was a very obvious design risk. The API is set up to prefer triggering email workflows which would make it hard for us to trigger in-app workflows.
