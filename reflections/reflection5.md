Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast)

The pacing of the capstone project started out slow initially which our group liked and then really picked up when we began to code. In week 8, we had a slight detour and fell behind somewhat but were able to recover and had a great week 9 and 10 demo presentation. All in all, I think we all agreed the pacing was just right but if we had managed our time better it would have prevented the timeline from feeling so fast towards the end. 

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

Initially, we had a bunch of stretch features we really wanted to get to like the use of a notification API to send user notifications when others interacted with their projects and content. This ended up falling through as Novu, the API we planned to use, proved to be a design risk because it was created to prefer email workflows over in-App workflows (which is what we needed). I think if we knew Novu was a design risk we would have spent more time trying to create the other stretch features we wanted to get to. Apart from Novu and some potential pages we wanted to add like a projects page to display most recent work, I don’t think we would have done anything differently in regards to the project’s development.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?

The labs and weekly assignments were very helpful. We were able to use the assignments from Week 4 to help us build the backend in our week 5 project and set up the Prisma database for this project. We eventually ended up scraping Prisma for Supabase but still found the foundation it provided us to be very useful.

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

I think our pod syncs and the mentors and instructors were pivotal to our project’s completion. When we initially shared our project plans, it was our mentors who advised us to start small and get as much done as possible and then go big and aim to finish as much fluff or nice to have functionality as possible. The instructors proved to be very helpful when we were having communication issues in week 8 and helped us fix all our bugs after the bug bash in week 9. The pod syncs gave us the space to ask our mentors to provide us needed constructive feedback to make the project as complete as we could make it.
