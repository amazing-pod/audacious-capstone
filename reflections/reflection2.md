## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We completed the entire frontend and began connecting with backend! We also integrated the clerk API in our site’s overall functionality meaning users can log in through clerk but also update user information through clerk on our site.


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Our group struggled with the occasional merge conflict. When trying to merge the forum branch into main, we had a tiny conflict. We also had to resolve the clerk API accidently restricting us from seeing our pages as we worked to restrict it from unregistered users.


* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We anticipated starting our stretch features this week but were able to finish what was required of us this week for the most part. I think we are just left with aspects of our project that would be considered stretch features but we also got to get caught up on assignments from last week that we didn't properly anticipate taking so long which was nice. 


* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, the resources provided helped with planning and executing the capstone project sprint this week, in particular the resource about how to plan an MVP was helpful.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Most of the features considered at risk are all stretch features which is a nice problem to have as the project would still be functional without these features but we anticipate that some of them will require more effort and thus will be at risk of being dropped. I don’t think any of our user stories would be considered at risk.
