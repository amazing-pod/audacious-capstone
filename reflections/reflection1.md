## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Andy:  Setting up User Authentication

Anita: Building the functionality of the forum

Brenda: Completing the login, register, and landing pages’ frontend and backend


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Brenda: Building the idea modal because the more developed the page became the more modals and user cases we had to consider. 

Andy: I struggled integrating the third party authentication with our database.

Anita: Trying to merge my forum changes without merge conflicts or crashing the site



* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Andy: I didn't get to build the brainstorm backend which was one of this week’s sprint tasks for me. I think I’ll reshuffle tasks next week to make sure I get to it.

Brenda: I didn’t get build the styling for the brainstorm page

Anita: I didn’t get to complete the functionality of the forum. Users cant create posts that generate onto the page. They also can’t filter so I will have to set that up next week.


* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 
Andy: I found the user Authentication video was helpful initially even though I ended up taking a different route to build the user authentication for our site.

Brenda: I felt like I could have gotten more assistance on techniques for our sprint plans. Like it would  have been nice to address the basic mockup of a plan and what a realistic plan looks like.

Anita: I found Erika’s tutorial on the Novu API helpful but I still need more support on backend integration


* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Andy: I think I can get to all the features and users stories in the mvp so I don't see myself changing plans.

Brenda: I also agree with Andy. I think we will be able to address them all.

Anita: Same point as Andy and Brenda.
