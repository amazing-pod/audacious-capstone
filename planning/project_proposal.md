Our project will stand out from these sites because our site will have a community forum that will allow users to discuss their ideas with other users. Monday.com is specifically for companies to organize their projects internally, while our project will work to help individuals manage their own projects and connect with users who may not be organizationally affiliated. Our site will also integrate AI to allow users to use AI to help them streamline their projects and the ideation process.
